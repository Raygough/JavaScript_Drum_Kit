# JavaScript Drum Kit
# JavaScript Drum Kit

This is a simple website that allows you to play drum sounds by pressing keys on your keyboard. Each key from "a" to "p" corresponds to a different drum sound.

## Usage

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Press the keys "a", "d", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", or "p" to play different drum sounds.
3. Enjoy creating your own beats!

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

The website utilizes JavaScript to listen for key presses and play the corresponding drum sound. When a key is pressed, an event is triggered, and the associated drum sound is played. The drum sounds are pre-loaded as audio files in the browser.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the website.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the key presses and plays the drum sounds.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drum-kit.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
